# GenomicInsights: A Web-Based Platform for DNA Sequence Analysis

## Description

GenomicInsights is a user-friendly web-based platform designed to analyze DNA sequences. The platform leverages dynamic programming algorithms to compare sequences, identify common subsequences, explore evolutionary relationships, detect genetic mutations, and analyze functional significance. This tool is ideal for researchers, bioinformatics enthusiasts, and students looking to delve into genetic data analysis.

## Features

- **DNA Sequence Comparison**: Enter two DNA sequences to find common subsequences.
- **Evolutionary Analysis**: Gain insights into evolutionary relationships by constructing phylogenetic trees.
- **Genetic Mutation Detection**: Detect mutations in the provided DNA sequences.
- **Functional Analysis**: Understand the functional significance of genetic data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for seamless interaction and analysis.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML**: Structures the web pages and defines their content.
- **CSS**: Styles the HTML elements, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- **JavaScript**: Provides interactive features such as form validation and dynamic content updates.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Uses JavaScript on the server-side to handle requests and perform data processing tasks.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js to create robust APIs for handling HTTP requests.

### Other Tools and Libraries
- **Mermaid**: Used to create the architecture diagram.

## Architecture

The architecture of GenomicInsights follows a client-server model. The frontend, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, handles user input and displays output. The backend processes requests from the frontend, performs data processing, and interacts with a database for data storage and retrieval. The backend employs dynamic programming algorithms to analyze DNA sequences, identify common subsequences, and perform additional analysis tasks.
